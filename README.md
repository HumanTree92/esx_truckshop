# About esx_truckshop:
Boat Shop for ESX Servers

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the esx_vehicleshop code to create this new shop. This code unlike most other versions out there do NOT interfere with the Original esx_vehicleshop.

This Boat Shop works just like esx_vehicleshop. However tho instead of Players buying Cars they can Buy/Sell Trucks. I created this because i couldn't find a Truck Shop Script & instead of waiting for others i went ahead & did it myself.
